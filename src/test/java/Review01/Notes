TestNG
TestNG is a tool used to perform unit and integration testing.

Data driven testing:
    When one Test cases execustes against multiple set of data, we call it data driven testing

Annotations:
@Test - It is a chief annotation of testing and every TC starts with it
By default it follows alphabetical order for execution

@BeforeMethod
@AfterMethod

= if else statments use in java/selenium

Verification vs Validation
Verification - checking the existence
Validation - checking the correctness of the field after existence

Assertion in TestNG

Hard assertion:
    Whenever assertion fails in hard assertion - it will stop the execution

Soft assertion:
    It allows us to have multiple verifications and validation checkpoints
    If assertions fails in between, it still allows us to execute the code till the last
    and will give the consolidated report
