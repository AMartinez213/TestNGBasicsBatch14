TestNG:

1) @BeforeClass -> Execute just once before the class starts to execute
   @AfterClass-> Execute just once after the whole class has been executed

2) DataProvider
   If we have a diverse data set then we can use data provider to feed the test data to our test case

   @dataProvide(name="Credentials")
   We declare the data in a form of a 2D Array

   If i want to use data provider in a test case
   @Test (dataProvider="Credentials")
   public void login(){

   }

   in order to use data from the 2D Array I must give it the parameters.
   the parameters are going to be equal to the number of columns, will follow the sequence.
   How many times the function @Test is going to execute?? --> equal to the number of rows we have in our Data provider

Listeners:

Why do we need listeners?
    Because we have no way of performing an action if our test case passes, or fails, ignore, etc.

How do we use listeners?
    1) Create a class that implements ITestListener
    @Override the function available to us in ITestListener

    onTestSuccess()
    onTestFailure()

    2) Link it to the class/package through the XML file.

    <suite>
        <listeners>
            <listener class-name="class03.listener">
            </listener>
        </listeners>
    </suite>
