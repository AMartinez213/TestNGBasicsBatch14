TestNG:
1) XML is a file format
2) How to create a maven project
    File-->new-->project
    new project --> build system (maven)
3) What is POM.xml
    It is an XML File
    We can add our dependencies here for our project
4) In POM.xml how do i add dependencies?
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupID>Selenium.org</selenium>
            <artifactsID>Selenium-Java</artifacts>
            <version>3.15.7</version>

        </dependency>

        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

5) What are the annotations?
    a) @Test --> all the test cases are written in this annotation
    b) @BeforeMethod --> this runs before every @Test annotation -->Pre-Condition
    c) @AfterMethod --> this will run after each @Test annotation -->Post-Condition
6) What is the purpose of enable/disable?
    @Test(enable=false) --> it will not run this test case --> we might use this if we want to not run a test case
7) Depends on what is the purpose?
    @Test(dependsOnMethods = ("Log-In") --> This test case depends on login and will be only executed if login  "Passed"
8) Priority?
    By default the priority is 0 --> highest order
    If two case are with 0 priority --> Alphabetically ascending will be followed

    @Test(priority=3)
    @Test(priority=2)
    @Test(priority=1)
    @Test(priority=4)
